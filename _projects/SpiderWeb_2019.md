Creating objects with threads is commonly referred as string art. It is typically a manual, tedious work reserved for skilled artists. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically fabricate string art pieces from one single continuous thread in such a way that it looks like an input image. The proposed system consists of a thread connection optimization algorithm and a custom-made fabrication machine. It allows casual users to create their own personalized string art pieces in a fully automatic manner. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated our system can create visually appealing results.
